# 24-Hourly-Bipartite-Graphs
Community structure using Fast-Greedy community detection algorithm and 24-hour bipartite graphs  derived from acoustic telemetry data of Bull Sharks and Tiger Sharks.

## Data Source

The primary dataset is hosted on Zenodo and can be accessed via [this link](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15250000).

## Contents

- `Bull_Bipartite_Graphs.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook applies the methodology to bull shark detection dataset, as described in the graphical abstract.

- `Tiger_Bipartite_Graphs.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook applies the same methodology to detection data specific to Tiger Sharks.

## Results

- `Bull/`: A directory containing the bipartite graph visualizations and community color-coded networks for Bull Sharks.

- `Tiger/`: A directory containing the same visualizations and networks for Tiger Sharks.

## How to use

1. Download the data from the Zenodo link.
2. Run `Bull_Bipartite_Graphs.ipynb` to apply the analysis and generate results for bull sharks.
3. Use `Tiger_Bipartite_Graphs.ipynb` the same for tiger sharks.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure dependencies for Jupyter and required Python packages are installed.
- Check the `Bull/` and `Tiger/` directories for output visualizations.
